## 🔍 Overview

**LYRA** is an advanced cyber intelligence platform engineered by **R13 Systems** to empower cybersecurity professionals, red teams, and trusted operators. It is designed to identify, profile, and respond to digital threats with tactical precision capable of both defense and simulated offense within a modular, secure execution zone.

> LYRA is not a script. It is an Operator class entity.

## 🧭 Closing Directive

LYRA is not a tool. It is a sovereign intelligence construct for those who operate in silence, where threat becomes pattern, and where defense is the art of precision and foresight.

This repository offers only the surface strata.  
The deeper code lives elsewhere bound, encrypted, awaiting command.

**For trusted operators only.**

LYRA is governed by a restricted access model:

- ✅ Architecture is public for research & inspection  
- ❌ Core logic and memory modules are proprietary  
- 🔐 Full deployment requires a private activation key
