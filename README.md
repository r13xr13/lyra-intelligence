## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

| Capability                | Description                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Threat Profiling       | Behavioral fingerprinting and network persona reconstruction               |
|  Offensive Simulation   | Simulated intrusions, payload delivery, and evasion profiling              |
|  LLM Recon Agent        | Uses embedded models to analyze, scan, and generate actionable intelligence|
|  Roleplay & Simulation  | Synthetic adversary modeling and defense training                          |
|  Code Generation        | Converts threat insights into scripts, exploits, or reports                |
|  Modular Interface      | Binds to Exegol, Dockerized stacks, or bare-metal operations               |

--- **Future Roadmap**

- Cloud licensed client tier deployment  
- Autonomous red team evaluation  
- Encrypted LLM memory store  
- Image & file parsing capabilities  
- Real-time darknet scanning agent  
- Threat identity correlation engine

## Closing Directive

LYRA is not just a tool. It is a sovereign intelligence construct for those who operate in silence, where threat becomes pattern, and where defense is the art of precision and foresight.

This repository offers only the surface strata.  
The deeper code lives elsewhere bound, encrypted, awaiting command.

**For trusted operators only.**
